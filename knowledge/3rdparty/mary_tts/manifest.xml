  <description brief="mary_tts">

     3rdparty wrapper for DFKI's Mary Text-to-speech system. Node listens to the /mary/tts topic and reads all published texts.

     Mary is based on human speech recordings, i.e. the models are larger than for formant-based systems like espeak, but the output is often more natural.
