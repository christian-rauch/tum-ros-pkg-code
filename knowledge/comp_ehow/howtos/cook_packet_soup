Get the package of the soup you're cooking.
You can use one package per person, depending on the size of the packet.
Use a measuring cup and fill it up with water.
Use the amount that the packet says to use.
Get the pot and place it on the stove top.
Pour the water into the pot.
Turn on the stove top.
Follow the heat level, whether it's low, medium, or high.
Pour the soup packet contents into the pot just as the water boils.
Look at the back of the packet for the time amount of cooking.
If you can't keep time mentally, look at a clock.
If it says 5:05 on the clock when you started, and the package says "Stir for 10 minutes", then you should stop when the clock says 5:15.
Strain your soup, if you want.
If the soup contains broth, for example, Chicken Noodle Soup, the broth or liquid is required for the dish.
Pour the soup or noodles into your eating bowl.
You can add many things to your soup.
Vegetables, pieces of meat, rice, different spices or seasonings, and butter are all suggestions.
