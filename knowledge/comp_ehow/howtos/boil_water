Choose a pot that's large enough to hold the amount of water you want to boil, and has a lid that fits.
Remember that the pot might have to be bigger than you'd think if you're going to add food to the water.
Without enough room in the pot, for example, rice or pasta will boil over.
Place the pot on a stove burner and pour cold water from a measuring cup into the pot.
Or, if you're doing something such as cooking pasta and don't need to measure, just run cold water from the tap into the pot, then place the pot on the burner.
Turn the burner to high.
Cover the pot.
Check for steam escaping from under the lid, then lift the lid carefully to see how the water is doing.
Look at the water.
If large bubbles are rising from the bottom of the pot to the surface, the water is boiling.
