Choose the bread you wish to use.
You can use just a regular white bread, or a specialty bread like rye, whole wheat or french.
Carefully put your slices of bread into the toaster (then plug it in).
Choose what settings to use.
Use a lower setting to start out with because some toasters tend to burn the toast easily.
Wearing an oven mitt, carefully remove the hot toast from the toaster after it pops up.
Place the toast on a plate, remove your oven mitt and spread toast with butter, jelly, jam, cheese spread or peanut butter on one side.
Slice in half, quarters, or leave whole.
Unplug the toaster using the plug.
Wipe up your mess and put away jars etc., and then carry your toast to the table.
ENJOY!!!!!
If you don't know these steps you won't have toast.
