  "Defines a new predicate for SWI Prolog.
   `name' is either a symbol specifying the name of the predicate or a
   list of the form (lisp-name prolog-name) with lisp-name being a
   symbol and prolog-name being a string specifying the name of the
   predicate as used in prolog.  Please note that in the first
   version, the name is pre-processed to generate the prolog
   name. That means '-' is converted to '_' and the predicate will be
   lower case.  

   `args' is a normal lambda list and `body' is the body of the
   predicate.  The return value must be a (lazy) list of solutions
   where a solution is a list of conses with the variable in its car
   and the value in its cdr."
