;;; This file provides the lazy data type delay.
;;; evaluation of expression is done when force is called
;;; on the object.

;;; Lazy lists are also provided. When generating a lazy list,
;;; an element generator must be passed. It gets the previously
;;; generated element as parameter (nil in first call) and
;;; returns t as second value when list is finished.
;;; When the list is fully expanded, it transforms into a normal
;;; list.

(defmacro lazy-list ((&rest params) &body body)
  "Creates a new lazy list.
   To return a lazy list, two additional forms are lexically bound
   within the body:
   (cont value . params) to return an element and pass the parameters
                         for generating the next element
   (finish value)        to return the last element of the list 
   (next . params )      to recall generator with new parameters without
                         generating a value

   With these forms, it is possible to return one element of a lazy list
   and to pass arguments to the next call of the body to create the next
   element. The parameter specification of lazy-list is similar to the let
   form. 

   example:
   (lazy-list ((i 0)) (when (< i 10) (cont i (1+ i))))
   i is initialized with 0, the list from 0 to 9 is returned"
