(in-package :cram-execution-trace)

;;; The tracing facility is kept quite general. Inherit from
;;; TRACING-INSTANCE-MIXIN if you want to trace (TRACE-INSTANCE) the state of
;;; an object by creating "snapshots" of the relevant state
;;; (MAKE-TRACED-INSTANCE) and relvant times (e.g. changes of the state) and
;;; adding those snapshots to a queue (APPEND-TO-TRACE).
;;;
;;; The snapshots should be objects of a type the
;;; inherits from TRACED-INSTANCE. Inherit form TRACED-ID-INSTANCE if you want
;;; every snapshots to include and id that is unique for EQ tracing objects.
;;;
;;; You can use a global instance trace queue where the snapshots are appended
;;; to or provide your own facilities by specializing the according methods.
;;;
;;; At the time of writing the only tracing objects are TRACING-FLUENTS and
;;; they use neither the global trace queue nor the id mechanism, so that part
;;; is unused. I keep the code in here for possible later use.
