  "Create a new lexical environment by augmenting ENV with new information.

   VARIABLE is a list of symbols to introduce as new variable bindings,
   SYMBOL-MACRO is a list symbol macro bindings of the form (name definition)
   MACRO is a list of macro definitions of the form (name definition), where
     definition is a function of two arguments (a form and an environment)
   FUNCTION is a list of symbols to introduce as new local function bindings
   DECLARE is a list of declaration specifiers.  Declaration specifiers
     attach to the new variable or function bindings as if they appeared
     in  let, let*, flet or labels form.  For example
     (augment-environment env :variable '(x) :declare '((special x)))
     is like (let (x) (declare (special x)) ....)
     but (augment-environment (augment-environment env :variable '(x))
