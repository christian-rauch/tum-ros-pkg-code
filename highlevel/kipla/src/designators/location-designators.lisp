(in-package :kipla-reasoning)

;;; Location designators are resolved a little bit differently than
;;; object designators (at least for now.) To resolve, the
;;; cram/reasoning prolog predicate desig-loc is used. All solutions
;;; are provided an can be accessed with next-solution. A mechanism is
;;; provided to post-process the solutions from reasoning, e.g. to
;;; sort according to eucledian distance.


;;; Same locations must not only be equatable but also eq!
;;; This is necessary to make rete work!
