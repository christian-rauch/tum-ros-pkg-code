     ias_drawer_executive
     opens drawers in the ias kitchen.
     the robot is driven to a hardcoded location that is know for each drawer.
     the right goes to a hardcoded joint state so that we see the ar toolkit marker on the drawer handle in the forearm camera.
     ik is then used to grasp at the marker, and the drawer is opened with some trajectory exploration, following the line of least resistance so to say.
