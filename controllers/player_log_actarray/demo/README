on robot with PowerCube modular arms. Check that working
version of player is installed: "which player"

1)Do cd laser_sweep_client && make && cd ..

2)Run script: "./start-all.sh"
This  -resets player's log file (demo.log), 
      -starts player server (using player-demo.cfg)
      -starts ros nodes (defined in demo.launch)

3)Run script "./start-player-client.sh"
This fires up player client controlling the PowerCube arm and
a laser scanner of choice. Follow the instruction in an interactive 
console to proceed with logging, sweeping and scanning.

4)Run "rosrun rviz rviz"
and subscribe to the topic laser_scan
