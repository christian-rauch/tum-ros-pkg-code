;;; We need to manage the task trees somehow. The idea is to have a hash-table
;;; containing one task-tree for every top-level plan. Otherwise, the
;;; task-tree management would become really really messy.
;;; --> see episode knowledge.

;;; TODO@demmeln: Add this to the docstring!
;;; Note: Don't have (certain kinds of) surrounding FLET / LABLES / MACROLET /
;;; SYMBOL-MACROLET / LET / ...  when using DEF-TOP-LEVEL-PLAN or
;;; DEF-PLAN. They could mess with (WITH-TAGS ...) or shadow globally defined
;;; plans, which would not be picked up by WITH-TAGS / EXPAND-PLAN.  See the
;;; comment before the definition of WITH-TAGS for more details.
