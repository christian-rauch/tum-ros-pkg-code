;;; Process modules
;;;
;;; A process module encapsulates interaction with the outer
;;; world. Implementing a new process module is rather easy:
;;; 
;;; (def-process-module test-pm (pm)
;;;   (format t "received input ~a~%" (input pm))
;;;
;;; Use pm-execute to send input to a running pm and use pm-cancel to
;;; cancel execution.
;;;
;;; Handling of priorities is not implemented yet.
