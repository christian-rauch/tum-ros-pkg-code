;;; Pass a form containing vars (in arbitrary nesting) as the first

;;; "anded"). FILTER-BINDINGS will return only bindings to the variables
;;; contained in `vars'. This can be used e.g. for complicated interactive
;;; queries to restrict the output to only what it wanted.

;;; FIXME: Could it happen, that some vars are bound to other variables, or to
;;; values that are not ground? There might be some interesting conflicts if
;;; those are not all gensymed. Investigate. Example:
;;;
;;; (force-ll (prolog '(and (filter-bindings ?x

;;;                     (== ?y 23)
;;;                     (== ?x 42))))
;;;
;;; Should this fail or succeed? At the moment it fails. For it to succeed, we
;;; would probably need to rename the variable ?y to a gensym, or in the
;;; general case rename all appearing variabels, that are not already gensyms.
