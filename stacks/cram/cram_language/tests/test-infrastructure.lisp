During the execution of BODY

  - errors are caught and turned into failures.

  - hangs are caught by an implicitly, or explicitly specified
    timeout.

  - spawned threads are collected. In case of an error, or timeout,
    these threads are killed. (They're not automatically killed in
    case of success, or 5AM:IS failure.)

  - in case of an error, or timeout, some statistics is printed along
    the error message on how many threads were created, how many
    threads terminated by themselves, how many threads aborted due to
    an error by themselves, and how many threads had to be killed.

CLAUSES can be one of

  (:N-RUNS <n>)

    specifies how many times BODY is executed. Defaults to
    5AM::*NUM-TRIALS* which again defaults to 100.

  (:TIMEOUT <timeout>)

    specifies a timeout in seconds, _per run_. If BODY does not
    terminate until the timeout expired, a failure is generated.
    Defaults to +TIMEOUT+.

  (:GENERATORS <bindings>+)

    specifies bindings for 5AM's random testing facility as per
    5AM:FOR-ALL.

  (:SKIP <reason>)

    specifies to skip over the test. (:SKIP) clauses are ignored in
    case *IGNORE-SKIPS* is true.

A documentation string must be given. Please document what your test
cases are supposed to test.
