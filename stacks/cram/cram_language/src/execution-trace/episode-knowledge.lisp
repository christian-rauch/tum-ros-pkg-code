(in-package #:cram-execution-trace)

;;; The epsiode knowedge consists of a task tree and an execution trace. There
;;; are two kinds of episode knowledge. LIVE-EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE and
;;; OFFLINE-EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE both deriving from EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE.
;;; 
;;; LIVE-EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE supports adding new (fluent-) traces to the
;;; execution trace and its TASK-TREE references real TASK objects. It might
;;; be, that some tasks are still executed. Every TOP-LEVEL(-PLAN) is
;;; associated with its own LIVE-EPIOSDE-KNOWLEDGE, which will be reset every
;;; time the plan is executed.
;;;
;;; OFFLINE-EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE has been loaded (from a file), doesn't support
;;; additional traces being added and its TASK-TREE references OFFLINE-TASK
;;; objects which contain only the correct fluent names and result values (but
;;; e.g. no thread objects).
;;;
;;; Both kinds of EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE objects can be queried for their (current)
;;; execution-trace / task-tree and they can be saved to a file.
;;;
;;; Accessing the execution trace of a live episode is thread safe, but
;;; accessing the task tree might not be. The offline episode is not thread
;;; safe at all (but it doesn't need to be anyway).
