Put a detergent tab into the small box inside the lid (they are stored beneath the sink).
Switch on the dishwasher by pushing the button on the right.
Stick a spoon handle into the hole that once contained the knob.
Turn the spoon clockwise until the straight part of the red piece inside the hole is vertical and the dishwasher starts to pump water.
