Select your bowl.
Use a bowl that is deep enough to hold both your choice of cereal and milk.
Choose a spoon.
Select a size according to your preference, or just use what is available.
Fill the bowl approximately 3/5ths full of cereal.
You can even use two, three, or more types of cereal if you are feeling the need to express yourself creatively.
Add milk to your own liking.
Use 2% (reduced fat content) for most mornings, but you can go to whole milk if you are feeling lavish, or skim milk if you are significantly overweight or you just prefer the taste.
Some people prefer water (cold or warm) or juice over their cereals.
Some prefer it dry.
It's a choice you need to make by trying the different variations.
Be an artist.
Garnish your cereal with freshly cut fruits (for example, strawberries, kiwi fruit, peach slices etc.) and maybe even some brown sugar or maple syrup.
Enjoy your work quickly before the cereal gets soggy.
Reflect.
