Bring 2 cups (480 ml) of water with a pinch of baking soda in a small pan to a rapid rolling boil.
Baking soda reduces any bitterness from steeping too long etc...
Turn off the heat and add 3 tea bags of your favorite tea.
Keep the tea bags in the water for 5 minutes only.
Anymore than that and your tea is going to be too bitter.
Pour the concentrated tea into a container of your choice that can hold 2 quarts (2 L) of liquid after it cools down.
Add sugar to your taste and fill with water.
Put the tea in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.
