* Location-designators must be persistent.
  The same location description _must_ lead to the same location designator.
  - TODO Use the make-designator method for this
    
* Perception and designators
  
  When perceive is called with a new designator without any parent, it
  must search for all instances of PERCEIVED-OBJECT that match the
  designator description and use them as bias. We then sort them by
  timestamp since we want to trust more current percepts more than
  older ones. If we find an object again with such a description, we
  use the corresponding designator to equate with. If not, we do a
  search with default parameters and try to find an equatable
  designator again.

* Change in PTU Handling: No more in perception!

  I think it makes more sense to make an own, very small process
  module for looking at somewhere. Add a macro 'LOOKING-AT'.
